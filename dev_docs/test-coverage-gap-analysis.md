2. **Sequencing Engine Core Logic Tests** - Prevents SCORM compliance violations
3. **Data Model State Management Tests** - Prevents data corruption

### Phase 2 (Short-term - Week 3-4): System Reliability
1. **IPC Communication Reliability Tests** - Prevents UI synchronization issues
2. **Error Recovery System Tests** - Prevents application crashes
3. **Performance Regression Detection** - Prevents performance degradation

### Phase 3 (Medium-term - Week 5-6): Quality and Security
1. **Content Viewer Security Tests** - Prevents XSS vulnerabilities
2. **File Manager Comprehensive Tests** - Prevents package processing issues
3. **End-to-End Workflow Tests** - Prevents integration regressions

## Success Metrics

### Immediate Success (Phase 1):
- **95%+ coverage** on critical paths (window management, sequencing, data model)
- **Zero unhandled exceptions** in core workflow tests
- **Sub-100ms response time** for all SCORM API calls under test conditions

### Short-term Success (Phase 2):
- **100% IPC message delivery** in reliability tests
- **Complete error recovery** in all failure scenario tests
- **Performance baseline established** with regression detection

### Long-term Success (Phase 3):
- **Zero security vulnerabilities** in content handling tests
- **Complete workflow coverage** for all supported SCORM features
- **Automated breaking change detection** integrated into CI/CD pipeline

## Implementation Strategy

### Test Development Approach:
1. **Start with highest-risk, lowest-coverage areas** (Window Manager, Sequencing Engine)
2. **Use real SCORM packages** for integration tests where possible
3. **Implement performance benchmarks** alongside functional tests
4. **Create reusable test utilities** to reduce test development overhead

### Integration with Existing Tests:
1. **Extend existing test suites** where possible rather than creating new files
2. **Maintain current test patterns** for consistency
3. **Ensure new tests integrate** with existing CI/CD pipeline
4. **Validate against current performance baselines** (200-600x performance targets)

This comprehensive test coverage enhancement will significantly improve our ability to detect breaking changes early while maintaining the high performance and reliability standards already achieved in the SCORM Tester application.
