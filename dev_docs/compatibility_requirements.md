# SCORM Compatibility Requirements

## Overview

This document outlines the **strict compatibility requirements** that SCORM packages must meet to function properly with the SCORM Tester application. These requirements are based on SCORM 2004 4th Edition specifications and are **non-negotiable assumptions** that the application makes to maintain simplicity, security, and reliability.

**CRITICAL:** The SCORM Tester application will **fail fast** on non-compliant packages rather than attempting to work around specification violations. This approach ensures reliable testing of properly structured SCORM content while preventing the application from becoming overly complex trying to handle broken or non-standard implementations.

## Core Compatibility Requirements

### 1. Manifest Location (STRICT REQUIREMENT)

#### Requirement
- **`imsmanifest.xml` MUST be located at the package root only**
- **NO recursive search** will be performed for the manifest file
- **COMPLIANCE FAILURE** if manifest is not found at the root level

#### SCORM Specification Reference
- SCORM 2004 4th Edition Content Aggregation Model (CAM)
- Section 3.4.1: "The imsmanifest.xml file shall be located at the root of the package interchange file."

#### Application Behavior
```javascript
// FileManager.getManifestInfo() - Strict root-only validation
const manifestPath = PathUtils.join(extractionPath, 'imsmanifest.xml');
if (!PathUtils.fileExists(manifestPath)) {
  throw new ParserError({
    code: ParserErrorCode.MANIFEST_NOT_FOUND,
    message: 'imsmanifest.xml not found at package root. SCORM packages must have the manifest file at the root level.',
    detail: { extractionPath, manifestPath }
  });
}
```

#### Error Message
```
SCORM Compatibility Error: imsmanifest.xml not found at package root
This SCORM package is not compliant with SCORM 2004 4th Edition specifications.
The manifest file must be located at the root of the package, not in a subdirectory.
```

#### Rationale
- **Simplification:** Eliminates complex recursive search logic that adds unnecessary complexity
- **Security:** Prevents path traversal attacks through manifest discovery
- **Reliability:** Ensures consistent package structure expectations
- **Performance:** Avoids expensive directory traversals

### 2. Content URL Resolution

#### Requirement
- **All content URLs must be relative to the manifest location** (package root)
- **xml:base attributes must resolve relative to package root**
- **Absolute URLs are not supported** within SCORM content

#### SCORM Specification Reference
- SCORM 2004 4th Edition Content Aggregation Model (CAM)
- Section 3.4.2: "All references to files shall be relative to the location of the imsmanifest.xml file"

#### Application Behavior
```javascript
// PathUtils.combineXmlBaseHref() - Root-relative resolution
const combinedPath = PathUtils.combineXmlBaseHref(xmlBase, href);
// Resolves relative to package root, not current resource location
```

#### Error Message
```
SCORM Compatibility Error: Invalid content path resolution
Content paths must be relative to the package root (manifest location).
Absolute paths and paths outside the package structure are not supported.
```

#### Rationale
- **Predictable Resolution:** Single resolution strategy eliminates ambiguity
- **Security:** Prevents access to files outside the package boundaries
- **Simplicity:** Removes complex base-directory detection logic

### 3. Package Structure Integrity

#### Requirement
- **Package must be a valid ZIP file or folder structure**
- **All referenced files must exist** within the package
- **No broken internal links** or missing assets

#### SCORM Specification Reference
- SCORM 2004 4th Edition Content Packaging (CP)
- Section 2.1: "A package shall be a collection of files organized in a directory structure"

#### Application Behavior
```javascript
// ContentValidator.validateContentFiles() - File existence validation
for (const file of contentFiles) {
  const fullPath = PathUtils.join(packageRoot, file.href);
  if (!PathUtils.fileExists(fullPath)) {
    throw new ParserError({
      code: ParserErrorCode.CONTENT_FILE_MISSING,
      message: `Referenced content file not found: ${file.href}`,
      detail: { filePath: fullPath, packageRoot }
    });
  }
}
```

#### Error Message
```
SCORM Compatibility Error: Missing content files
The following files referenced in the manifest are missing from the package:
- shared/launchpage.html
- content/sco1/index.html

Please ensure all referenced files are included in the package.
```

#### Rationale
- **Data Integrity:** Ensures complete package before attempting to load content
- **User Experience:** Clear error messages help developers fix packaging issues
- **Performance:** Fail fast rather than attempting to load incomplete content

### 4. Security Boundaries

#### Requirement
- **No path traversal attempts** (../../../etc/passwd, etc.)
- **All file access must stay within package boundaries**
- **No access to system files** or directories outside the package

#### Application Behavior
```javascript
// PathUtils.validatePath() - Security validation
const isValid = PathUtils.isValidPath(resolvedPath, packageRoot, nativePath);
if (!isValid) {
  throw new ParserError({
    code: ParserErrorCode.SECURITY_VIOLATION,
    message: 'Path traversal attempt detected',
    detail: { attemptedPath: resolvedPath, allowedRoot: packageRoot }
  });
}
```

#### Error Message
```
SCORM Compatibility Error: Security violation detected
Path traversal attempts are not allowed. All content must be within the package boundaries.
```

#### Rationale
- **Security:** Prevents malicious path traversal attacks
- **Compliance:** Enforces SCORM security model
- **Reliability:** Prevents access to unintended system files

### 5. File Format Standards

#### Requirement
- **XML files must be well-formed** and valid according to SCORM schemas
- **Manifest must validate against SCORM 2004 4th Edition XSD schemas**
- **Character encoding must be UTF-8** or properly declared

#### Application Behavior
```javascript
// ManifestParser.parse() - XML validation
try {
  const manifest = await this.parseXml(manifestContent);
  // Validate against SCORM schema
  const validation = this.validateManifest(manifest);
  if (!validation.isValid) {
    throw new ParserError({
      code: ParserErrorCode.MANIFEST_VALIDATION_ERROR,
      message: `Manifest validation failed: ${validation.errors.join(', ')}`,
      detail: { validationErrors: validation.errors }
    });
  }
} catch (error) {
  // Handle XML parsing errors
}
```

#### Error Message
```
SCORM Compatibility Error: Invalid manifest format
The imsmanifest.xml file contains XML errors or does not conform to SCORM 2004 4th Edition schema:
- Missing required <organizations> element
- Invalid namespace declaration

Please validate your manifest against the SCORM XSD schemas.
```

#### Rationale
- **Standards Compliance:** Ensures adherence to SCORM specifications
- **Interoperability:** Guarantees compatibility with other SCORM systems
- **Error Prevention:** Catches structural issues before runtime

## Application Design Philosophy

### Fail Fast Principle

The SCORM Tester application follows a **"fail fast"** design philosophy for compatibility issues:

1. **Immediate Detection:** Compatibility issues are detected as early as possible in the loading process
2. **Clear Error Messages:** Users receive specific, actionable error messages explaining what needs to be fixed
3. **No Workarounds:** The application does not attempt to "fix" non-compliant packages
4. **Standards Enforcement:** Strict adherence to SCORM specifications prevents ambiguity

### Benefits of Strict Compatibility

#### For Users
- **Predictable Behavior:** Compliant packages always work the same way
- **Clear Feedback:** Specific error messages help fix compatibility issues
- **Reliable Testing:** Only tests properly structured SCORM content

#### For Developers
- **Simplified Code:** No complex fallback logic or edge case handling
- **Easier Maintenance:** Clear compatibility boundaries reduce bug surface area
- **Better Testing:** Focused testing on compliant SCORM implementations

#### For SCORM Ecosystem
- **Standards Compliance:** Reinforces proper SCORM implementation practices
- **Interoperability:** Ensures compatibility with other SCORM-compliant systems
- **Quality Assurance:** Helps maintain high quality in SCORM content development

## Implementation Details

### Error Classification

All compatibility errors are classified using the `ParserError` system:

```javascript
enum ParserErrorCode {
  MANIFEST_NOT_FOUND = 'MANIFEST_NOT_FOUND',
  MANIFEST_VALIDATION_ERROR = 'MANIFEST_VALIDATION_ERROR',
  CONTENT_FILE_MISSING = 'CONTENT_FILE_MISSING',
  SECURITY_VIOLATION = 'SECURITY_VIOLATION',
  PATH_RESOLUTION_ERROR = 'PATH_RESOLUTION_ERROR'
}
```

### Logging and Debugging

All compatibility checks include comprehensive logging:

```javascript
logger.info('SCORM Compatibility: Starting package validation', {
  operation: 'compatibilityCheck',
  packagePath: extractionPath,
  phase: 'VALIDATION'
});

logger.error('SCORM Compatibility: Validation failed', {
  operation: 'compatibilityCheck',
  error: error.message,
  errorCode: error.code,
  packagePath: extractionPath
});
```

### User Interface Integration

Compatibility errors are displayed through the application's error handling system:

- **Modal Error Dialogs:** Clear error messages with specific guidance
- **Error Details:** Technical details available for debugging
- **Recovery Options:** Suggestions for fixing compatibility issues
- **Logging Integration:** All errors logged to application log file

## Testing and Validation

### Automated Compatibility Tests

The application includes comprehensive compatibility validation:

```javascript
// Test suite for compatibility requirements
describe('SCORM Compatibility Requirements', () => {
  test('should reject packages without root manifest', async () => {
    // Test manifest in subdirectory
  });

  test('should reject packages with path traversal', async () => {
    // Test ../../../etc/passwd style paths
  });

  test('should reject packages with missing content files', async () => {
    // Test broken internal references
  });
});
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Manifest at package root
- [ ] All content files present
- [ ] No path traversal attempts
- [ ] Valid XML structure
- [ ] Proper SCORM namespaces
- [ ] Relative content URLs
- [ ] No absolute file paths

## Future Compatibility Considerations

### Version-Specific Requirements

As SCORM evolves, additional compatibility requirements may be added:

- **SCORM 2004 4th Edition** (current): Strict root manifest requirement
- **Future Versions:** May include additional validation rules

### Extension Points

The compatibility validation system is designed to be extensible:

```javascript
// Plugin-style compatibility validators
interface CompatibilityValidator {
  validate(package: ScormPackage): ValidationResult;
  getErrorCode(): ParserErrorCode;
}

// Register new validators
compatibilityManager.registerValidator(new CustomValidator());
```

## Summary

The SCORM Tester application's strict compatibility requirements ensure:

1. **Reliable Operation:** Only compliant packages are processed successfully
2. **Clear Error Messages:** Users understand exactly what needs to be fixed
3. **Security:** Path traversal and other security issues are prevented
4. **Standards Compliance:** Reinforces proper SCORM implementation practices
5. **Maintainability:** Simplified codebase with clear compatibility boundaries

**Key Principle:** As a SCORM compliance testing tool, we **fail fast** on non-compliant packages rather than trying to work around specification violations. This ensures the application remains focused, secure, and reliable for its core purpose: testing properly implemented SCORM content.
