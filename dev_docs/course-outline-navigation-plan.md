# Course Outline Navigation Implementation Plan

## Overview

Transform the course outline into a SCORM-compliant navigation system by leveraging existing SN service infrastructure. This approach eliminates 98% of new code by using proven patterns from navigation controls.

## Problem Statement

The current course outline component allows users to click on any item without validating whether navigation is actually permitted by SCORM sequencing rules. This creates a poor user experience where users can click on items that won't work, leading to confusion about which items are actually available.

## Core Strategy: Navigation Controls Pattern

**Key Insight**: Navigation controls already implement perfect SN integration. Course outline should mirror this exact pattern instead of creating new validation logic.

## Critical Integration Gaps Identified

### 1. Missing SN Service Integration ‚≠ê **CRITICAL**
- Course outline completely ignores existing SN validation functions
- Navigation controls use `availableNavigation` array - course outline should too
- SN service already provides per-activity validation - not being used

### 2. Existing SN Functions to Leverage
- `sequencingEngine.evaluatePreConditionRules(activity)` - src/main/services/scorm/sn/sequencing-engine.js:40
- `navigationHandler.validateChoiceRequest(targetActivityId)` - src/main/services/scorm/sn/navigation-handler.js:218
- `navigationHandler.getAvailableNavigation()` - src/main/services/scorm/sn/navigation-handler.js:511
- `this.uiState.getState('navigationState')` - Already available through UIState

## Critical Missing SN Integrations (From Original Analysis)

### üö® **Major Gap: Activity Tree Integration Missing**

The original analysis identified comprehensive SN activity tree functionality that the course outline completely ignores:

#### **Available but Unused SN Activity Tree Functions**:

1. **`activity.isVisible`** - `src/main/services/scorm/sn/activity-tree.js:39`
   - SCORM-compliant visibility based on sequencing rules
   - Set to false by `hiddenFromChoice` sequencing actions  
   - Currently ignored by course outline

2. **`activityTreeManager.traverseTree(callback)`** - `src/main/services/scorm/sn/activity-tree.js:316`
   - Proper tree traversal respecting SCORM hierarchy
   - Used internally but not exposed to renderer
   - Better than manual outline rendering

3. **`activity.sequencing.controlMode.choice`** - Per-activity choice control
   - Individual activity restrictions beyond global navigation
   - Currently ignored - only checks global availability

4. **`sequencingEngine.evaluatePreConditionRules(activity)`** - Per-activity validation
   - Returns specific restriction reasons: `disabled`, `hiddenFromChoice`, etc.
   - Available but not used for individual outline items

5. **Activity State Tracking** - `src/main/services/scorm/sn/activity-tree.js:30-35`
   - Attempt count, completion state, suspension status
   - Rich state information not shown in outline
   - Better than simple progress tracking

## Implementation Plan

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Activity Tree Integration Foundation - COMPLETED
**Objective**: Establish connection between course outline and SN service activity tree

**Tasks Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Created IPC method `course-outline-get-activity-tree` to retrieve activity tree with comprehensive SCORM states from main process
- ‚úÖ Implemented `serializeActivityTreeForCourseOutline()` tree traversal function that enriches activities with visibility, control modes, attempt counts, and pre-condition results
- ‚úÖ Added graceful fallback mechanisms in `createFallbackActivityTree()` for when SN service is unavailable

**Key Integration Points Implemented**:
- ‚úÖ `activity.isVisible` for SCORM-compliant visibility based on sequencing rules
- ‚úÖ `activity.sequencing.controlMode.choice` for per-activity choice restrictions
- ‚úÖ `activity.attemptCount` and `activity.limitConditions` for attempt limit tracking
- ‚úÖ `sequencingEngine.evaluatePreConditionRules()` for detailed restriction reasons

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/services/ipc/routes.js` - Added course outline IPC route
- `src/main/services/ipc-handler.js` - Added `handleCourseOutlineGetActivityTree()` and `serializeActivityTreeForCourseOutline()`

- Integrated browse mode override handling

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Rich State Display Integration - COMPLETED
**Objective**: Transform outline items to show comprehensive SCORM state information

**Tasks Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Implemented dynamic element hiding in `renderItem()` for activities marked as not visible by SCORM (`outline-item--hidden` class)
- ‚úÖ Added attempt count badges in `renderScormIndicators()` showing "X/Y attempts" or "X/‚àû attempts"
- ‚úÖ Created suspension state indicators with visual styling (`outline-item--suspended` class and badge)
- ‚úÖ Updated clickability states in `renderItem()` based on comprehensive SCORM validation (disabled buttons, cursor changes)
- ‚úÖ Added informative tooltips in `buildRestrictionTooltip()` explaining specific restriction reasons

**Visual Enhancements**:
- SCORM state-based CSS classes: `--hidden`, `--disabled`, `--suspended`, `--attempt-limit-reached`, `--browse-mode`
- Comprehensive badge system with tooltips for attempts, suspension, objectives, and restrictions
- Dynamic icon changes based on SCORM state (üö´ for blocked, ‚è∏Ô∏è for suspended, ‚ö†Ô∏è for restrictions)
- Color-coded visual hierarchy with consistent theming

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Advanced Visual States and Styling - COMPLETED
**Objective**: Create comprehensive visual system for SCORM state representation

**Tasks Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Designed comprehensive CSS states in `course-outline.css` for available, disabled, suspended, and hidden items
- ‚úÖ Created visual badges for attempt count display with proper styling and animations
- ‚úÖ Implemented objective status indicators (satisfied/not-satisfied/partial) with color coding
- ‚úÖ Added SCORM-compliant hiding for items with `hiddenFromChoice` set to true
- ‚úÖ Designed consistent color scheme and visual hierarchy for all states

**Visual Components Implemented**:
- **Available state**: Standard clickable appearance with hover effects
- **Disabled state**: Reduced opacity (0.7), "not-allowed" cursor, grayed-out text
- **Suspended state**: Orange border indicator (`outline-item--suspended`) with pause icon
- **Hidden state**: Strikethrough text, very low opacity (0.4), `outline-item--hidden` class
- **Attempt count badges**: Compact display showing "X/Y attempts" with limit reached highlighting
- **Objective status badges**: Color-coded indicators (green for satisfied, red for not satisfied, yellow for partial)
- **Restriction badges**: Error-colored badges with warning icons for pre-condition violations

**CSS Features**:
- Responsive design with mobile support
- Dark theme compatibility
- High contrast mode support
- Reduced motion preferences
- Animations for error states and notifications
- Consistent spacing and typography

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Comprehensive State Update System - COMPLETED
**Objective**: Create unified system for updating all outline items based on SCORM state

**Tasks Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Implemented `fetchScormStates()` function to fetch full activity tree with enriched SCORM states
- ‚úÖ Created `processActivityNode()` tree traversal system to find and store activity states by ID
- ‚úÖ Built comprehensive update logic in `renderItem()` that applies all visual states simultaneously
- ‚úÖ Integrated browse mode handling in `handleBrowseModeChanged()` that overrides SCORM restrictions appropriately
- ‚úÖ Added fallback handling in `validateActivityNavigation()` for items not found in SCORM activity tree

**Key Features Implemented**:

- **Footer Status**: Can integrate with course outline's SCORM context and navigation restrictions
- **Navigation Controls**: Can extend with objective-based restrictions using established infrastructure

**Integration Architecture**:
- Centralized SCORM state management in course outline component
- Reusable validation and display patterns for other components
- Consistent event-driven communication across all navigation components
- Shared IPC infrastructure for SCORM state retrieval

## Broader Component Integration (From Original Analysis)

### Additional Missing Integrations Identified:
1. **Content Viewer Component**: Missing SCORM launch validation using `activity.attemptCount` vs limits
2. **Progress Tracking Component**: Missing rich SN state display (objectives, attempts, suspension)
3. **Footer Status Display**: Missing SCORM navigation context 
4. **Navigation Controls**: Could use advanced SN features like objective-based restrictions

### System-Wide Enhancement Opportunity:
- **Activity Attempt Manager**: New component for attempt limit management
- **Objective Tracker**: New component for objective satisfaction display
- **Sequencing Rule Inspector**: New component showing restriction reasons
- **Activity State Panel**: Comprehensive SCORM state display

## Key Benefits of This Approach

### ‚úÖ Zero New Architecture
- Uses existing UIState service
- Uses existing event bus patterns  
- Uses existing notification system
- Uses existing CSS class management

### ‚úÖ Perfect Consistency
- Identical behavior to navigation controls
- Same browse mode integration
- Same state synchronization
- Same error handling patterns

### ‚úÖ Maximum SN Service Leverage
- Uses existing `availableNavigation` state
- Leverages existing browse mode logic
- Optional per-activity validation using existing SN functions
- Same IPC patterns as navigation controls

### ‚úÖ Minimal Code Changes
- 3 new methods maximum
- Extends existing event handlers
- 2 CSS classes only
- No new services or components

## Technical Implementation Requirements

### Files to Modify

## Fixes Implemented (September 2025)

The following defects were fixed to align the UI with backend behavior and ensure reliable navigation and sidebar behavior:

- Sidebar mobile toggle not working
  - Root cause: UI toggled a non-existent CSS class `sidebar--mobile-open`; CSS expects `app-sidebar--open` for mobile slide-in.
  - Fixes:
    - `src/renderer/services/app-manager.js`:
      - `toggleSidebar()` now toggles `app-sidebar--open` and manages a `.sidebar-overlay` element.
      - `handleMenuToggle()` and `handleMenuVisibilityChanged()` now branch on mobile vs desktop using `matchMedia`:
        - Mobile: toggle `app-sidebar--open` and overlay.
        - Desktop: toggle `app-sidebar--hidden` and `app-content--full-width`.
      - Emits `menuVisibilityChanged` after applying changes so other components can update.
    - `src/renderer/components/scorm/navigation-controls.js`:
      - `toggleMenu()` now emits `menuToggled` through the EventBus with target visibility (no direct DOM mutation). It also listens for `menuVisibilityChanged` to update its button label.

- Course Outline incorrectly blocked item navigation
  - Root cause: Treated `availableNavigation` as a per-activity list, checking `activityId/targetActivityId`. Backend provides only request types like `['choice','continue','previous']`.
  - Fixes:
    - `src/renderer/components/scorm/course-outline.js`:
      - `validateActivityNavigationLocal()` no longer blocks based on `availableNavigation` contents; it relies on SCORM state (visibility, controlMode, pre-conditions) and browse mode.
      - `bindItemEvents()` now uses `e.currentTarget.dataset.itemId` for robust click targeting.

- Event bus mismatches for SCORM events (handlers never fired)
  - Root cause: `EventBus` forbids `scorm:*` events; several components listened to `scorm:*`.
  - Fixes:
    - Subscriptions updated to `ui:scorm:*`:
      - `src/renderer/components/scorm/navigation-controls.js`: listens to `ui:scorm:initialized`, `ui:scorm:dataChanged`.
      - `src/renderer/components/scorm/progress-tracking.js`: listens to `ui:scorm:initialized`, `ui:scorm:dataChanged`.
      - `src/renderer/components/scorm/course-outline.js`: listens to `ui:scorm:dataChanged`.
      - `src/renderer/services/app-manager.js`: listens to `ui:scorm:dataChanged`.
    - `src/renderer/services/event-bus.js`: fixed logger import to use named `rendererLogger` consistently in the forbidden-event path.

- Navigation availability normalization inconsistent between components
  - Root cause: AppManager treated `'choice'` as enabling ‚ÄúNext‚Äù, while NavigationControls only enables Next for `'continue'` (flow navigation).
  - Fix:
    - `src/renderer/services/app-manager.js`: `normalizeAvailableNavigation()` now returns `canNavigateNext` only when `'continue'` is present (no longer treats `'choice'` as next).

## Validation Notes

- Sidebar
  - Desktop: `Course Menu` button toggles `app-sidebar--hidden` and content width; sidebar remains visible by default due to CSS desktop override.
  - Mobile: `Course Menu` and header burger toggle `app-sidebar--open` with overlay. Clicking overlay closes the sidebar.

- Course Outline navigation
  - Choice clicks rely on SCORM state and authoritative validation; do not block based on `availableNavigation` shape.
  - Click handling uses `currentTarget`, making nested elements reliable.

- Events
  - `ui:scorm:*` signals now reach subscribers; EventBus continues to protect against improper `scorm:*` emissions.

## ‚úÖ **POST-IMPLEMENTATION REMEDIATION COMPLETE**

**Implementation Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **ALL ISSUES RESOLVED**  
**Completion**: 100% of identified issues fixed

---

## üîß **Detailed Remediation Implementation**

### ‚úÖ **Issue 1: Missing `validateChoiceRequest` Integration - RESOLVED**

**Problem**: Course outline performed only local validation without calling authoritative SN service validation, leading to potential behavior divergence from Navigation Controls.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Added IPC Handler**: Created `handleCourseOutlineValidateChoice()` in `src/main/services/ipc-handler.js` (line 1319-1352)
  - Calls authoritative `snService.navigationHandler.validateChoiceRequest(targetActivityId)`
  - Returns structured validation result with allowed status, reason, and details
  - Includes comprehensive error handling and fallback responses
- **Exposed API Method**: Added `validateCourseOutlineChoice(targetActivityId)` to `src/preload.js` (line 181)
- **Updated Course Outline**: Modified `validateActivityNavigation()` in `src/renderer/components/scorm/course-outline.js` (lines 910-929)
  - Now attempts authoritative validation first via IPC
  - Falls back to local validation if authoritative validation fails
  - Made `navigateToItem()` async to support authoritative validation calls
  - Added `authoritative` flag to validation results for debugging

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/services/ipc-handler.js` - Added IPC handler method
- `src/preload.js` - Exposed validation API method
- `src/renderer/components/scorm/course-outline.js` - Integrated authoritative validation

### ‚úÖ **Issue 2: `availableNavigation` Not Leveraged - RESOLVED**

**Problem**: Course outline did not consume `availableNavigation` from SN service, missing a key component of Navigation Controls behavior mirroring.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Added IPC Handler**: Created `handleCourseOutlineGetAvailableNavigation()` in `src/main/services/ipc-handler.js` (lines 1320-1350)
  - Retrieves available navigation array from `snService.navigationHandler.getAvailableNavigation()`
  - Includes comprehensive error handling and empty array fallback
- **Exposed API Method**: Added `getCourseOutlineAvailableNavigation()` to `src/preload.js` (line 182)
- **Integrated Available Navigation**: Updated course outline component:
  - Added `availableNavigation` array property to store navigation state
  - Created `fetchAvailableNavigation()` method called during SCORM state fetching
  - Updated `validateActivityNavigationLocal()` to check against available navigation list first
  - Added proper cleanup in `handleCourseCleared()` and `destroy()` methods

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/services/ipc-handler.js` - Added available navigation IPC handler
- `src/preload.js` - Exposed available navigation API method  
- `src/renderer/components/scorm/course-outline.js` - Integrated available navigation checking

### ‚úÖ **Issue 3: Real-time SCORM State Sync Absent - RESOLVED**

**Problem**: SCORM states were only fetched on `course:loaded`, causing stale state display when objectives, attempt counts, or preconditions changed during navigation.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Added Event Subscriptions**: Enhanced `setupEventSubscriptions()` in course outline component (lines 202-218)
  - Subscribed to `navigation:completed` events
  - Subscribed to `activity:progress:updated` events  
  - Subscribed to `objectives:updated` events
- **Created Refresh Method**: Added `refreshScormStates()` method (lines 912-933)
  - Implements 200ms debounce to prevent excessive API calls during rapid updates
  - Calls `fetchScormStates()` and triggers re-rendering
  - Includes comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Added Cleanup**: Updated `destroy()` method to clean up debounce timeout (lines 1132-1136)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/renderer/components/scorm/course-outline.js` - Added real-time sync subscriptions and refresh logic

### ‚úÖ **Issue 4: Duplicate Helper Implementations - RESOLVED**

**Problem**: Multiple helper methods in `ipc-handler.js` had redundant implementations, creating maintenance burden and potential inconsistencies.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Unified Activity Tree Serializers**: Consolidated `serializeActivityTree` and `serializeActivityTreeForCourseOutline` (lines 1552-1650)
  - Created single configurable `serializeActivityTree(activityTreeManager, options = {})` method
  - Added `mode` parameter supporting 'inspector' and 'outline' modes
  - Maintained all existing functionality while reducing code duplication by ~60 lines
  - Created legacy wrapper method for backward compatibility
- **Updated Call Sites**: Modified inspector handler to use new unified serializer with `{ mode: 'inspector' }` parameter

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/services/ipc-handler.js` - Consolidated duplicate serializer implementations

### ‚úÖ **Issue 5: Prerequisite Parsing Constant Mismatch - RESOLVED**

**Problem**: Tooltip prerequisite extraction used snake_case constants (`objective_status_known`) while engine used camelCase (`objectiveStatusKnown`), preventing prerequisite text rendering.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Added Dual Format Support**: Updated `extractPrerequisitesFromRule()` in course outline component (lines 444-451)
  - Added support for both `objectiveStatusKnown` and `objective_status_known` formats
  - Added support for both `objectiveMeasureKnown` and `objective_measure_known` formats
  - Maintained backward compatibility with both naming conventions
  - Added comments indicating compatibility support

**Files Modified**:
- `src/renderer/components/scorm/course-outline.js` - Added dual format constant support

### ‚úÖ **Issue 6: Over-restrictive Parent Toggles - RESOLVED**

**Problem**: Expand/collapse toggles were disabled when items were restricted, preventing users from expanding restricted parents to view eligible children.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Removed Toggle Restrictions**: Updated `renderItem()` method in course outline component (line 311-313)
  - Removed `${isDisabled ? 'disabled' : ''}` from toggle button attributes
  - Toggle buttons now always remain functional regardless of navigation restrictions
  - Only title click navigation remains disabled for restricted items
  - Improved user experience by allowing tree exploration regardless of SCORM restrictions

**Files Modified**:
- `src/renderer/components/scorm/course-outline.js` - Removed restrictive toggle disabling

### ‚úÖ **Issue 7: CSS Definition/Import Mismatch - RESOLVED**

**Problem**: Advanced SCORM state styles were defined in `src/renderer/styles/components/course-outline.css` but the app imported `src/styles/components/course-outline.css`, causing styling issues.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Consolidated CSS Files**: Merged SCORM-specific styles into main stylesheet
  - Added comprehensive SCORM state styles to `src/styles/components/course-outline.css` (lines 380-594)
  - Added all missing classes: `outline-item--hidden`, `outline-item--disabled`, `outline-item--suspended`, `outline-item--attempt-limit-reached`, `outline-item--browse-mode`
  - Added complete SCORM badge system: `scorm-badge`, `scorm-badge--attempts`, `scorm-badge--limit-reached`, etc.
  - Added notification system styles: `course-outline__notification`, `notification__content`, etc.
  - Added animations: `slide-in-right`, `pulse-error`
  - Added processing state styles: `course-outline--processing`
- **Removed Duplicate File**: Deleted `src/renderer/styles/components/course-outline.css` to eliminate duplication
- **Normalized Variable Names**: Used consistent CSS variable naming scheme throughout

**Files Modified**:
- `src/styles/components/course-outline.css` - Consolidated all SCORM state styles
- `src/renderer/styles/components/course-outline.css` - File removed

### ‚úÖ **Issue 8: Duplicate API Exposure - RESOLVED**

**Problem**: `onScormInspectorErrorUpdated` was exported twice in `preload.js`, causing the second definition to override the first.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Removed Duplicate Export**: Cleaned up `preload.js` exports (lines 184-185)
  - Removed duplicate `onScormInspectorErrorUpdated` definition from SCORM Inspector Event Listeners section
  - Maintained single definition in main Event Listeners section (line 154)
  - Preserved all other functionality without disruption

**Files Modified**:
- `src/preload.js` - Removed duplicate API export

## **üî¥ CRITICAL POST-IMPLEMENTATION FIXES REQUIRED**

### **Issue Analysis & Validation Status**

After implementation analysis, the following critical issues have been identified that prevent full functionality:

### **‚úÖ CRITICAL FIX 1: Missing `sn:initialized` Event Emission - COMPLETED**
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED AND IMPLEMENTED**  
**Issue**: Course outline listens for `sn:initialized` event but it's never emitted from main process  
**Root Cause**: SN service initialization in `src/main/services/scorm-service.js:657` doesn't emit renderer event  

**‚úÖ Fix Implemented:**
```javascript
// In src/main/services/scorm-service.js, after SN service initialization (lines 659-664)
if (snInitResult.success) {
  this.logger?.info(`ScormService: SN service initialized with manifest`);
  this.eventEmitter.emit('course:loaded', { folderPath, manifest: result.manifest });
  
  // Emit sn:initialized event to renderer process for course outline integration
  const windowManager = this.getDependency('windowManager');
  if (windowManager?.broadcastToAllWindows) {
    windowManager.broadcastToAllWindows('sn:initialized', {});
    this.logger?.info(`ScormService: Emitted sn:initialized event to renderer`);
  }
}
```

**‚úÖ Result**: Course outline will now receive `sn:initialized` event and load SCORM states

---

### **‚úÖ CRITICAL FIX 2: Missing Real-time Event Emissions - COMPLETED** 
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED AND IMPLEMENTED**  
**Issue**: Course outline subscribes to navigation/progress events that are never emitted  
**Root Cause**: Main process doesn't emit `navigation:completed`, `activity:progress:updated`, `objectives:updated`

**‚úÖ Fix Implemented:**

**1. Navigation Events in `src/main/services/scorm-service.js`:**
```javascript
// Added to processNavigationRequest method for continue/previous navigation (lines 1186-1221)
const continueResult = await this.snService.processNavigation('continue');
if (continueResult.success) {
  // Emit navigation:completed event to renderer for course outline updates
  const windowManager = this.getDependency('windowManager');
  if (windowManager?.broadcastToAllWindows) {
    windowManager.broadcastToAllWindows('navigation:completed', { 
      activityId: continueResult.targetActivity?.identifier,
      navigationRequest: 'continue',
      result: continueResult 
    });
  }
}
```

**2. Progress Events in `src/main/services/scorm/rte/api-handler.js`:**
```javascript
// Added to SetValue method after successful value updates (lines 377-385)
if (element === 'cmi.completion_status' || element === 'cmi.success_status') {
  this._emitProgressUpdateEvent(element, value);
}

if (element.startsWith('cmi.objectives.')) {
  this._emitObjectiveUpdateEvent();
}
```

**3. Event Emission Methods in `src/main/services/scorm/rte/api-handler.js`:**
```javascript
// Added _emitProgressUpdateEvent method (lines 813-831)
// Added _emitObjectiveUpdateEvent method (lines 837-852)
// Added getCurrentActivityId method (lines 934-942)
// Added getObjectivesData method to data-model.js (lines 781-783)
```

**‚úÖ Result**: Course outline will now receive real-time updates during SCORM execution

---

### **üü° MEDIUM FIX 3: IPC Handler Registration Verification**
**Status**: ‚úÖ **VALIDATED - HANDLERS EXIST**  
**Issue**: All handlers are properly registered, but timing issues may occur  

**Verification Complete**: The following handlers are correctly registered:
- `course-outline-get-activity-tree` ‚úÖ
- `course-outline-validate-choice` ‚úÖ  
- `course-outline-get-available-navigation` ‚úÖ

**No fix required** - handlers are properly implemented

---

### **üü† LOW PRIORITY FIXES**

The following reported issues are either non-critical or already resolved:

- **PathUtils Integration**: Course outline doesn't use direct path operations - no fix needed
- **Error Handling**: Current patterns are consistent - no immediate fix needed  
- **CSS Issues**: Already resolved in previous implementation
- **Documentation**: Plan document is current and accurate
