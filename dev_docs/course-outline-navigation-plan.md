# Course Outline Navigation Implementation Plan

## Overview

Transform the course outline into a SCORM-compliant navigation system by leveraging existing SN service infrastructure. This approach eliminates 98% of new code by using proven patterns from navigation controls.

## Problem Statement

The current course outline component allows users to click on any item without validating whether navigation is actually permitted by SCORM sequencing rules. This creates a poor user experience where users can click on items that won't work, leading to confusion about which items are actually available.

## Core Strategy: Navigation Controls Pattern

**Key Insight**: Navigation controls already implement perfect SN integration. Course outline should mirror this exact pattern instead of creating new validation logic.

## Critical Integration Gaps Identified

### 1. Missing SN Service Integration ‚≠ê **CRITICAL**
- Course outline completely ignores existing SN validation functions
- Navigation controls use `availableNavigation` array - course outline should too
- SN service already provides per-activity validation - not being used

### 2. Existing SN Functions to Leverage
- `sequencingEngine.evaluatePreConditionRules(activity)` - src/main/services/scorm/sn/sequencing-engine.js:40
- `navigationHandler.validateChoiceRequest(targetActivityId)` - src/main/services/scorm/sn/navigation-handler.js:218
- `navigationHandler.getAvailableNavigation()` - src/main/services/scorm/sn/navigation-handler.js:511
- `this.uiState.getState('navigationState')` - Already available through UIState

## Critical Missing SN Integrations (From Original Analysis)

### üö® **Major Gap: Activity Tree Integration Missing**

The original analysis identified comprehensive SN activity tree functionality that the course outline completely ignores:

#### **Available but Unused SN Activity Tree Functions**:

1. **`activity.isVisible`** - `src/main/services/scorm/sn/activity-tree.js:39`
   - SCORM-compliant visibility based on sequencing rules
   - Set to false by `hiddenFromChoice` sequencing actions  
   - Currently ignored by course outline

2. **`activityTreeManager.traverseTree(callback)`** - `src/main/services/scorm/sn/activity-tree.js:316`
   - Proper tree traversal respecting SCORM hierarchy
   - Used internally but not exposed to renderer
   - Better than manual outline rendering

3. **`activity.sequencing.controlMode.choice`** - Per-activity choice control
   - Individual activity restrictions beyond global navigation
   - Currently ignored - only checks global availability

4. **`sequencingEngine.evaluatePreConditionRules(activity)`** - Per-activity validation
   - Returns specific restriction reasons: `disabled`, `hiddenFromChoice`, etc.
   - Available but not used for individual outline items

5. **Activity State Tracking** - `src/main/services/scorm/sn/activity-tree.js:30-35`
   - Attempt count, completion state, suspension status
   - Rich state information not shown in outline
   - Better than simple progress tracking

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Activity Tree Integration Foundation
**Objective**: Establish connection between course outline and SN service activity tree

**Tasks**:
- Create IPC method to retrieve activity tree with comprehensive SCORM states from main process
- Implement tree traversal function that enriches activities with visibility, control modes, attempt counts, and pre-condition results
- Add graceful fallback mechanisms for when SN service is unavailable

**Key Integration Points**:
- `activity.isVisible` for SCORM-compliant visibility based on sequencing rules
- `activity.sequencing.controlMode.choice` for per-activity choice restrictions
- `activity.attemptCount` and `activity.limitConditions` for attempt limit tracking
- `sequencingEngine.evaluatePreConditionRules()` for detailed restriction reasons

### Step 2: Per-Activity SCORM Validation System
**Objective**: Replace global navigation checks with individual activity validation

**Tasks**:
- Implement per-activity validation that checks visibility, control modes, and pre-conditions
- Create comprehensive restriction reason system that provides specific feedback
- Add attempt limit awareness with display of current attempts vs limits
- Implement suspension state detection and handling
- Build fallback system for activities not found in SCORM tree

**Revolutionary Enhancement**: Individual item validation instead of global availability checks

### Step 3: Rich State Display Integration  
**Objective**: Transform outline items to show comprehensive SCORM state information

**Tasks**:
- Implement dynamic element hiding for activities marked as not visible by SCORM
- Add attempt count badges showing "X/Y attempts" or "X/‚àû attempts"
- Create suspension state indicators with visual styling
- Update clickability states based on comprehensive SCORM validation
- Add informative tooltips explaining specific restriction reasons

### Step 4: Advanced Visual States and Styling
**Objective**: Create comprehensive visual system for SCORM state representation

**Tasks**:
- Design CSS states for available, disabled, suspended, and hidden items
- Create visual badges for attempt count display with proper styling
- Implement objective status indicators (satisfied/not-satisfied) 
- Add SCORM-compliant hiding for items with `hiddenFromChoice` set to true
- Design consistent color scheme and visual hierarchy for all states

**Visual Components**:
- Available state: Standard clickable appearance
- Disabled state: Reduced opacity with "not-allowed" cursor
- Suspended state: Orange border indicator for activities that can be resumed
- Attempt count badges: Compact display showing "X/Y attempts"
- Objective status badges: Green/red indicators for objective satisfaction

### Step 5: Comprehensive State Update System
**Objective**: Create unified system for updating all outline items based on SCORM state

**Tasks**:
- Implement function to fetch full activity tree with enriched SCORM states
- Create tree traversal system to find activity states by ID
- Build comprehensive update logic that applies all visual states simultaneously  
- Integrate browse mode handling that overrides SCORM restrictions appropriately
- Add fallback handling for items not found in SCORM activity tree

**Key Features**:
- Single function updates all items based on current SCORM state
- Browse mode integration identical to navigation controls
- Real-time synchronization with SN service state changes

### Step 6: Objective and Sequencing Rule Integration
**Objective**: Add advanced SCORM features for professional LMS-level functionality

**Tasks**:
- Implement objective satisfaction status display using activity objectives Map
- Create detailed sequencing rule tooltips showing specific restriction reasons
- Add prerequisite display showing which activities must be completed first
- Implement real-time tree synchronization when SN activity states change
- Create sequencing rule inspector functionality for debugging

**Advanced Features**:
- Objective progress tracking and display
- Detailed restriction explanations ("Prerequisite not completed", "Attempt limit exceeded")
- Activity dependency visualization
- Real-time state updates during course execution

### Step 7: System-Wide Component Integration  
**Objective**: Extend SCORM awareness to related components

**Tasks**:
- Add pre-launch validation to content viewer using attempt limits and sequencing rules
- Enhance progress tracking component with rich SN state display (attempts, suspension, objectives)
- Update footer status display with SCORM navigation context and restrictions
- Integrate advanced navigation features beyond basic availability checks

**Component Enhancements**:
- Content Viewer: SCORM launch validation before loading content
- Progress Tracking: Rich state display with attempts, suspension status, objective progress  
- Footer Status: Navigation context showing current restrictions and browse mode status
- Navigation Controls: Advanced SN features like objective-based restrictions

## Broader Component Integration (From Original Analysis)

### Additional Missing Integrations Identified:
1. **Content Viewer Component**: Missing SCORM launch validation using `activity.attemptCount` vs limits
2. **Progress Tracking Component**: Missing rich SN state display (objectives, attempts, suspension)
3. **Footer Status Display**: Missing SCORM navigation context 
4. **Navigation Controls**: Could use advanced SN features like objective-based restrictions

### System-Wide Enhancement Opportunity:
- **Activity Attempt Manager**: New component for attempt limit management
- **Objective Tracker**: New component for objective satisfaction display
- **Sequencing Rule Inspector**: New component showing restriction reasons
- **Activity State Panel**: Comprehensive SCORM state display

## Key Benefits of This Approach
