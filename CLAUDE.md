## Development Patterns

### SCORM API Implementation
- Synchronous API behavior to maintain SCORM compliance
- Local caching with background sync for performance
- Multi-version support (SCORM 1.2 and 2004)
- Proper SCORM error codes and recovery mechanisms

### Component Architecture
- **Event-driven communication** through centralized event bus
- **Service-oriented design** with clear separation of concerns
- **Modular UI components** with standardized lifecycle management
- **State management** with persistence and history

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error boundaries at all levels
- SCORM-compliant error codes and messages
- Automatic recovery mechanisms where possible
- Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring

### Resource Management
- Automatic cleanup of extracted SCORM packages
- Memory monitoring with configurable thresholds
- Session isolation to prevent data contamination
- Performance tracking and optimization

## Key Dependencies

- **Electron 28.0.0** - Desktop application framework
- **node-stream-zip 1.15.0** - ZIP extraction for SCORM packages
- **Jest 29.0.0** - Testing framework
- **ESLint 8.0.0** - Code linting
- **electron-builder 24.13.3** - Application packaging

## File Operations

SCORM packages can be loaded as:
- ZIP files (automatically extracted to temp directory)
- Directories (direct folder access)
- Supports nested package structures and manifest parsing

All file operations include path validation and security checks to prevent directory traversal attacks.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
1. **File Size Limit**: All files must be under 200 lines (except index.html under 300)
2. **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns with focused modules
3. **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript definitions for all interfaces
4. **Test Coverage**: Maintain comprehensive test coverage for all changes
5. **SCORM Compliance**: Validate against SCORM 2004 4th Edition specification

### Architecture Principles
- **Event-driven communication** between components
- **Service-oriented design** with dependency injection
- **Immutable state management** with proper persistence
- **Component lifecycle management** with cleanup
- **Error handling** with graceful degradation

### Documentation Requirements
- Update relevant documentation when making architectural changes
- Maintain JSDoc comments for all public APIs
- Keep TypeScript definitions synchronized with implementation
- Update test documentation for new test scenarios

## Interactive Testing with Playwright MCP

### Remote Debugging Setup
The application supports remote debugging for AI-powered testing and interaction through Playwright MCP:

**1. Launch Application with Remote Debugging:**
```bash
npm run dev:remote-debug
```
This command starts the Electron app with:
- `--remote-debugging-port=9222` - Enables Chrome DevTools Protocol on port 9222
- `--remote-allow-origins=*` - Allows connections from any origin

**2. Connect via Playwright MCP:**
- Navigate to `http://localhost:9222` to see available debugging targets
- Click on "SCORM Tester" to access the application through DevTools
- Use Playwright MCP browser tools to interact with the running application

**3. Available Interactions:**
- **UI Testing**: Click buttons, fill forms, navigate through the application
- **Screenshot Capture**: Take screenshots of the current application state
- **DOM Inspection**: Examine and interact with UI elements
- **JavaScript Evaluation**: Execute custom scripts within the application context
- **Event Simulation**: Simulate user interactions for testing workflows

**4. Common Use Cases:**
- **Automated Testing**: Test SCORM package loading and validation workflows
- **UI Validation**: Verify interface elements and user experience
- **Debugging**: Inspect application state during SCORM course execution
- **Documentation**: Capture screenshots for documentation purposes
- **Quality Assurance**: Validate application behavior with real user interactions

**Note**: The remote debugging session remains active until the application is closed. Multiple debugging connections can be established simultaneously.

### Playwright MCP Best Practices - Token-Efficient Debugging

Based on extensive debugging experience, follow these guidelines to avoid token limit issues and maximize debugging efficiency:

#### **ðŸš« Avoid These Token-Heavy Operations:**

1. **Never use `browser_snapshot` on complex UIs**
   - DevTools, admin interfaces, or rich applications generate 25k+ token responses
   - Use only for simple pages or specific testing scenarios

2. **Avoid element-based interactions requiring refs**
   - `browser_click` with `ref` parameters requires snapshots first
   - Snapshots of complex apps exceed token limits
   - Use direct JavaScript evaluation instead

3. **Don't use `browser_evaluate` in DevTools context**
   - Even minimal JavaScript returns massive responses when connected to DevTools
   - DevTools DOM context is enormous and will hit token limits

4. **Avoid iterative DOM exploration**
   - Don't try to "browse" through complex UIs step by step
   - Plan specific targeted interactions instead of exploratory debugging

#### **âœ… Efficient Token-Saving Strategies:**

1. **Use Screenshots Strategically**
   - **Good**: Single verification screenshots (`browser_take_screenshot`)
   - **Bad**: Screenshots for interaction or detailed inspection
   - **Best**: Before/after comparison shots to verify changes

2. **Direct Navigation Over Interaction**
   - Use `browser_navigate` to specific URLs when possible
   - Avoid clicking through complex navigation paths

3. **Minimal JavaScript Evaluation**
   - Return only essential data (booleans, strings, small objects)
   - Avoid returning DOM elements or large data structures
   - Filter and summarize results before returning

4. **Console Monitoring for Events**
   - Use `browser_console_messages` for lightweight debugging
   - Add targeted logging to application code instead of DOM inspection
   - Monitor specific event patterns rather than full console output

5. **Network Requests for State Verification**
   - Use `browser_network_requests` to understand application behavior
   - Often more informative than DOM inspection for state changes

#### **ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Debugging Workflow:**

1. **Analyze code statically first** (using Read/Grep tools)
2. **Make targeted fixes based on code analysis**
3. **Use single screenshot for visual verification**
4. **Use console/network monitoring for behavior verification**
5. **Avoid interactive debugging through MCP for complex applications**

#### **ðŸ“‹ Application-Specific Considerations:**

- **Electron Apps**: Custom protocols (`scorm-app://`) aren't directly accessible via browser navigation
- **DevTools Connection**: Connecting to DevTools creates massive DOM contexts that exceed token limits
- **Complex SPAs**: Better to test via API endpoints, logs, or unit tests than DOM manipulation
- **Real-time Applications**: Use event monitoring rather than polling for state changes

#### **ðŸ”§ When MCP Isn't the Right Tool:**

- **Complex UI testing**: Use traditional testing frameworks (Jest, Cypress) instead
- **Interactive debugging**: Use browser DevTools directly for detailed inspection
- **Performance testing**: Use dedicated performance tools and profilers
- **Deep DOM inspection**: Use browser inspector manually for complex element analysis

#### **ðŸ’¡ Token-Efficient Alternatives:**

- **Code Analysis**: Use file reading and grep tools to understand logic
- **Static Testing**: Write unit tests for component behavior
- **Log-Based Debugging**: Add console.log statements and monitor output
- **API Testing**: Test backend endpoints directly rather than UI interactions
- **Screenshot Verification**: Use visual confirmation rather than programmatic inspection

This approach prioritizes **efficiency over comprehensive interaction** - use MCP for verification and targeted testing, not as a replacement for traditional debugging tools.
