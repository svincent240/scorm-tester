# SCORM Tester Refactoring Migration Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive refactoring plan to transform the SCORM Tester from a monolithic Electron application into a modern, modular, SCORM 2004 4th Edition compliant system with enhanced maintainability and AI tool compatibility.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Architecture Issues
- **Monolithic Files**: `main.js` (1507 lines) and `app.js` (1570 lines) contain mixed concerns
- **Tight Coupling**: Components are heavily interdependent
- **Limited Modularity**: Difficult to extend or modify individual features
- **Inconsistent Patterns**: Different error handling and logging approaches
- **Documentation Gaps**: Missing API documentation and architectural overview

### Technical Debt Assessment
```
File Size Analysis:
├── main.js: 1507 lines (Target: <200 lines)
├── app.js: 1570 lines (Target: <200 lines)  
├── index.html: 1120 lines (Target: <300 lines)
├── preload.js: 375 lines (Acceptable)
└── utils/*.js: Various sizes (Some need splitting)

Complexity Metrics:
├── Cyclomatic Complexity: High in main process handlers
├── Coupling: Tight coupling between UI and business logic
├── Cohesion: Low cohesion within large files
└── Testability: Limited due to monolithic structure
```

## Target Architecture

### Design Goals
1. **SCORM 2004 4th Edition Full Compliance**
2. **Modular Architecture** with clear separation of concerns
3. **File Size Limits** (max 200 lines per file)
4. **AI Tool Compatibility** with comprehensive documentation
5. **Enhanced Maintainability** and extensibility
6. **Comprehensive Testing** with SCORM compliance validation
